# Plant_genome_assembly
BOSS mini project on plant genome assembly

## Description
Aim:

The study uses several genomic and bioinformatics approaches. In this project, participants will be required to reproduce the genomic analysis carried out in the study. The data will be available from NCBI. You are expected to: Download the sequence data programmatically, carry out DNA sequence pre-processing and de novo assembly and perform genome annotation of the plant of interest.

## Manuscript to reproduce:

Chang, Y., Liu, H., Liu, M., Liao, X., Sahu, S. K., Fu, Y., Song, B., Cheng, S., Kariba, R., Muthemba, S., Hendre, P. S., Mayes, S., Ho, W. K., Yssel, A. E. J., Kendabie, P., Wang, S., Li, L., Muchugi, A., Jamnadass, R., … Liu, X. (2018). The draft genomes of five agriculturally important African orphan crops. 8, 1–16. https://doi.org/10.1093/gigascience/giy152 

## Set objectives

1. To determine genome location associated with crucial agronomic traits
2. To arrive at similar conclusions as those in the paper?

## key questions

- Are you able to determine genome location associated with crucial agronomic traits?
- Are you able to arrive at similar conclusions as those in the paper? Why or why not?
- Are the descriptions in the methodology section detailed for reproducibility? If not, what could you have done to improve reproducibility?

## The Progress (17/12/21)
### Quick update
This study reported the draft genomes of 5 agriculturally important orphan crops i.e. Vigna subterranean, Lablab purpureus, Faidherbia albida, Sclerocarya birrea and Moringa oleifera. Of the five plants we chose to work with Moringa oleifera which has been observed to have heterozygosity varying from 0.16 to 0.86, with an average of 0.58. it is also diploid with a chromosome number of 2n = 2x = 28 in somatic cells.
